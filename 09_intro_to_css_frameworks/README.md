This project [SDF09] taught me how to use Tailwinds althought I struggled to use them, it's not difficult but rather Just new for me, the project was to make a footer using tailwinds, i have used a few tailwinds but 
because to me being new to it i struggled and needed to resort back to most Css functions, for example the @media , listing items and backups for the subscribe button incase the tailwind doen't work. I tried my best 
to get the Footer as close to the pictures that was provided in the project [SDF09] but failed when it came to the layout changes with the desktop and ipad.( I got the code to be responsive) I used tailwind for the 
button and for the email text box.
